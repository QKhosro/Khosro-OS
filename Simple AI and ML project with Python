This simple Python machine learning and artificial intelligence project involves building a simple classifier to predict lily flower species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
We will use Python, the scikit-learn library and the famous Iris dataset for this.


Project requirements:

*Install Python
*The scikit-learn library

The code of this simple Python project is as follows:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load Iris dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv"

# Prepare data
X = df.drop("species", axis=1)
y = df["species"]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

#The output of the above simple Python project is as follows:

Accuracy: 1.0
