This simple Python machine learning and artificial intelligence project involves building a simple classifier to predict lily flower species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
We will use Python, the scikit-learn library and the famous Iris dataset for this.


Project requirements:

*Install Python
*The scikit-learn library

The code of this simple Python project is as follows:
##
  import pandas as pd
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

  # Load Iris dataset
  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv"

  # Prepare data
  X = df.drop("species", axis=1)
  y = df["species"]

  # Split data into training and testing sets
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
